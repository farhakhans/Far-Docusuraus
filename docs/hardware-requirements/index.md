# Hardware Requirements Overview

This section outlines the various hardware configurations available for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics program. We offer multiple options to accommodate different budgets, space constraints, and learning objectives.

## Available Kits {#available-kits}

We provide three primary hardware configurations:

- **Economy Kit**: Cost-effective solution for individual learners and small groups
- **Edge Kit**: Mid-tier solution with enhanced capabilities for more advanced projects
- **Robot Lab Options**: Comprehensive setup for institutional use with multiple stations

## Selection Guide {#selection-guide}

Choosing the right hardware configuration depends on several factors:

- **Budget**: Available funding for hardware acquisition
- **Space**: Physical space available for robot operation
- **Scale**: Number of students who will use the hardware
- **Objectives**: Specific learning goals and project complexity
- **Maintenance**: Resources available for ongoing hardware maintenance

## Common Components {#common-components}

All configurations include:

- Computing platform (varies by kit)
- Basic sensors (IMU, cameras, encoders)
- Control electronics
- Power systems
- Basic structural components

## Additional Considerations {#additional-considerations}

- Shipping and import duties (for international orders)
- Local safety regulations and compliance
- Insurance and warranty options
- Training and support services
- Future upgrade paths
