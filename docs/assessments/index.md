# Assessments Overview

This section provides an overview of the assessment methods used throughout the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics educational program. Assessments are designed to evaluate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.

## Assessment Philosophy {#assessment-philosophy}

Our assessment approach emphasizes:
- **Practical Application**: Demonstrating skills through implementation
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from basic to advanced concepts
- **Real-World Relevance**: Tasks that mirror actual robotics challenges
- **Continuous Feedback**: Regular evaluation and improvement opportunities

## Assessment Types {#assessment-types}

### Formative Assessments {#formative-assessments}
- **Quizzes**: Knowledge checks throughout modules
- **Code Reviews**: Peer and instructor feedback on implementations
- **Simulation Tests**: Validating robot behaviors in controlled environments
- **Peer Evaluations**: Collaborative learning and feedback

### Summative Assessments {#summative-assessments}
- **Module Projects**: Comprehensive projects at the end of each module
- **Integration Challenges**: Multi-module tasks requiring system integration
- **Capstone Project**: Complete robotics system implementation
- **Portfolio Review**: Collection of best work throughout the program

## Grading Criteria {#grading-criteria}

### Technical Proficiency (40%) {#technical-proficiency-40}

## Assessment Schedule {#assessment-schedule}

Assessments are distributed throughout the program to provide regular feedback and track progress:

- **Weekly**: Small quizzes and practical exercises
- **Module-end**: Comprehensive projects demonstrating module concepts
- **Mid-program**: Integration challenges combining multiple modules
- **Program-end**: Capstone project integrating all learned concepts

## Resources and Support {#resources-and-support}

### Assessment Resources {#assessment-resources}
- **Rubrics**: Detailed grading criteria for each assessment
- **Examples**: Sample submissions and best practices
- **Templates**: Standardized formats for submissions
- **Tools**: Software and platforms for assessment completion

### Support Systems {#support-systems}
- **Office Hours**: Regular instructor availability
- **Peer Support**: Collaborative learning opportunities
