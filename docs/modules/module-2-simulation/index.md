# Module 2: Simulation

Welcome to the Simulation module! This module focuses on using simulation environments to develop, test, and validate robotic systems before deploying them to real hardware. Simulation is a critical component of robotics development, allowing for safe, repeatable, and cost-effective testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up and configure simulation environments (Gazebo and Unity)
- Model robot sensors and physics properties accurately
- Implement physics simulations for robotic systems
- Test robot algorithms in simulated environments
- Transition from simulation to real-world deployment (Sim-to-Real)

## Module Overview

Simulation provides a safe environment to test robotic algorithms without risk to hardware or humans. This module covers two primary simulation platforms used in robotics:

1. **Gazebo**: A physics-based simulation environment with realistic rendering
2. **Unity**: A game engine-based platform for advanced simulation and visualization

### Key Concepts
