# Modules Overview

The Physical AI Humanoid Robotics curriculum is organized into four progressive modules, each building upon the previous one to provide a comprehensive learning experience. This modular approach allows students to develop expertise incrementally while maintaining focus on practical applications.

## Module Structure

Each module includes:

- **Theoretical Foundations**: Core concepts and principles
- **Practical Applications**: Hands-on implementation exercises
- **Assessment Projects**: Module-specific projects to demonstrate mastery
- **Integration Elements**: Connections to other modules and real-world applications

## Module Prerequisites

- **Module 1**: Basic programming knowledge (Python)
- **Module 2**: Completion of Module 1 or equivalent knowledge
- **Module 3**: Completion of Modules 1-2 or equivalent knowledge
- **Module 4**: Completion of Modules 1-3 or equivalent knowledge

## Learning Progression

The modules are designed to follow a natural learning progression:

1. **Foundation**: Establish core concepts and tools (Module 1)
2. **Simulation**: Develop skills in safe, controlled environments (Module 2)
3. **Advanced Integration**: Work with sophisticated platforms (Module 3)
4. **AI Integration**: Combine perception, cognition, and action (Module 4)

## Assessment and Certification

Students must demonstrate proficiency in each module before advancing to the next. Assessment includes:

- Practical exercises and implementations
- Module-specific projects
- Integration challenges that connect multiple concepts
- Capstone project incorporating all modules

## Flexibility and Customization

While the modules follow a recommended sequence, institutions may adapt the curriculum based on their specific needs, resources, and student backgrounds. Each module can be taught independently with appropriate prerequisites.
