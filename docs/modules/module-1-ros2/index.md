# Module 1: ROS2 Fundamentals

Welcome to the ROS2 Fundamentals module! This module provides the essential foundation for working with the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2), which serves as the backbone for most robotics applications in this curriculum.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the architecture and concepts of ROS2
- Create and manage ROS2 nodes, topics, and services
- Implement basic robot control and communication
- Debug and troubleshoot ROS2 systems
- Use ROS2 tools for visualization and analysis

## Module Overview

ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an operating system but rather a middleware framework that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster. It includes hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

### Key Concepts

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Messages**: Data packets sent between nodes
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge in Python or C++
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with package management systems
- Basic understanding of distributed systems concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several key sections:

1. **Nodes, Topics, and Services**: Core ROS2 communication patterns
2. **rclpy**: Python client library for ROS2
3. **URDF**: Unified Robot Description Format
4. **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on implementation challenges

## Assessment

Module completion requires successful implementation of practical exercises that demonstrate understanding of core ROS2 concepts and the ability to create functional ROS2 applications.

Let's begin exploring the fundamental concepts of ROS2!
