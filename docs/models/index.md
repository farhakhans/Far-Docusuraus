# Models Overview

This section provides an overview of the theoretical and practical models used throughout the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics curriculum. These models form the foundation for understanding how artificial intelligence and physical systems interact.

## Core Model Categories

### Physical AI Models
- Theoretical frameworks for embodied intelligence
- Learning algorithms for physical interaction
- Sensorimotor integration models
- Adaptive behavior systems

### Humanoid Robotics Models
- Kinematic and dynamic models
- Control theory applications
- Biomechanical inspiration
- Locomotion and manipulation models

## Learning Approach

The curriculum integrates these models through:

- **Theoretical Study**: Understanding the mathematical and conceptual foundations
- **Simulation**: Testing models in controlled virtual environments
- **Implementation**: Applying models to real robotic systems
- **Iteration**: Refining understanding through experimentation

## Prerequisites

Before diving into specific models, students should have:

- Basic understanding of linear algebra
- Knowledge of calculus and differential equations
- Familiarity with probability and statistics
- Programming experience in Python

## Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated based on:

- **Applicability**: How well it addresses specific robotics challenges
- **Scalability**: Performance with increasing complexity
- **Robustness**: Behavior under uncertainty and noise
- **Interpretability**: Understanding of the model's decision-making process

## Integration with Curriculum

Models are introduced progressively throughout the modules:

- **Module 1**: Foundational models for ROS2 systems
- **Module 2**: Simulation and control models
- **Module 3**: Advanced perception and navigation models
- **Module 4**: Vision-language-action integration models
