# Physical AI Models

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI approaches, emphasizing the integration of intelligence with physical interaction in real-world environments.

## Definition and Core Principles

Physical AI is the field of artificial intelligence focused on systems that learn and interact through physical embodiment. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of real-world physics, uncertainty, and continuous interaction.

### Key Principles:
- **Embodiment**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between agent and environment
- **Embodied Cognition**: Physical form and sensorimotor experiences shape cognitive processes
- **Morphological Computation**: Physical properties contribute to computational processes
- **Continuity**: Continuous interaction with dynamic environments

## Theoretical Foundations

### Embodied Intelligence Theory
The theory that intelligent behavior emerges from the coupling of cognitive processes with physical form and environmental interaction. This challenges traditional computational approaches to intelligence.

### Active Inference
A framework where agents minimize uncertainty by acting on their environment, not just passively observing it. This includes:
- Predictive processing models
- Free energy principle applications
- Action-perception cycles

### Morphological Computing
The concept that physical properties of a system can be exploited for computation, reducing the burden on central processing units.
