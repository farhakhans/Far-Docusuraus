# Program Overview

The Physical AI Humanoid Robotics educational program represents a cutting-edge curriculum designed to prepare students for the future of robotics and artificial intelligence. This program combines theoretical foundations with hands-on practice to create well-rounded robotics engineers.

## Program Philosophy

Our approach is grounded in the belief that the future of robotics lies in the seamless integration of physical systems with artificial intelligence. We emphasize:

- **Embodied Intelligence**: Understanding how physical interaction shapes intelligent behavior
- **Practical Application**: Moving beyond theory to implement real robotic systems
- **System Integration**: Connecting perception, cognition, and action in unified systems
- **Scalable Learning**: Building skills that transfer from simulation to reality

## Curriculum Structure

The curriculum is organized into four progressive modules, each building upon the previous one:

### Module 1: ROS2 Fundamentals
Foundation concepts for modern robotics software development, focusing on distributed systems and robot communication.

### Module 2: Simulation
Advanced simulation techniques for testing and developing robotic systems in safe, repeatable environments.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac
Integration with industry-leading robotics platforms and GPU-accelerated AI systems.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action Systems
Cutting-edge approaches to embodied AI that connect perception, language, and motor control.

## Technology Stack

The program leverages state-of-the-art tools and platforms:

- **ROS2**: Robot Operating System 2 for robotics software development
- **Gazebo/Unity**: Physics simulation environments
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: GPU-accelerated robotics development platform
