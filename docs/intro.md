# Introduction to Physical AI Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics educational program. This comprehensive curriculum is designed to guide you from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations in the field of humanoid robotics and physical artificial intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this program, you will be able to:

- Understand the principles of physical AI and its applications in humanoid robotics
- Implement robotic systems using ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Design and simulate robotic systems in various environments
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems for intelligent robot behavior
- Apply advanced AI techniques to control humanoid robots

## Course Structure

The course is organized into four main modules:

1. **ROS2 Fundamentals** - Foundation concepts and practical applications
2. **Simulation** - Working with simulation environments for robotics
3. **NVIDIA Isaac** - Advanced robotics platform integration
4. **Vision-Language-Action Systems** - Integrating perception and cognition

Each module builds upon the previous one, providing a progressive learning experience that takes you from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Hardware Requirements

Different hardware kits are available depending on your resources and goals. Check the Hardware Requirements section for detailed information about economy, edge, and lab options.

## Assessment Methods

Throughout the course, you will complete various assessments including:

- Practical exercises after each major topic
